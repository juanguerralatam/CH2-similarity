JIE89dneaGo,Manage your Cloud Run secrets securely with Secret Manager,"Code shown in this episode → https://goo.gle/3boFqFb
Secret Manager docs → https://goo.gle/3eFNtzm

Secret Manager is a secure and convenient storage system for API keys, passwords, certificates, and other sensitive data that provides a central place and single source of truth to manage, access, and audit secrets across Google Cloud. In this episode of Serverless Expeditions Extended, Martin demos how you can update an existing Cloud Run service to use Secret Manager without changing any code and while applying the Principle of Least Privilege. Watch to learn how you can use Secret Manager with your Cloud Run service!

3:45 - What did we achieve?
4:47 - Two other ways of accessing Secret Manager
5:42 - Wrap-up

Clarification on the video: if you mount a secret as an environment variable (and point it to the “latest” version of that secret), the latest value of the secret is loaded whenever a Cloud Run instance of your service is started. This happens all the time. So even if you don’t re-deploy your Cloud Run service yourself, the new value of the secret will eventually make it into your Cloud Run service.

yuCduiNA-Jk,Cloud Run GKE with Donna Malayeri: GCPPodcast 203,"Original post → https://goo.gle/2LfOz5Z

Jon and Aja host our guest Donna Malayeri this week to learn all about Cloud Run and Anthos! Designed to provide serverless containers, Cloud Run has two versions: fully managed and Cloud Run for Anthos.

Donna’s passion for serverless projects and containers shows as we discuss how these options benefit developers and customers. With containers, developers are able to go serverless without a lot of the typical restrictions, and because they are a standard format, containers are fairly easy to learn to use. Tools such as Ko can even do the work of generating docker containers for you. One of Cloud Run’s most unique features is that it allows developers to bring existing applications. You don’t have to rewrite your entire app to make it serverless! Developers can also reuse instances, making the process more efficient and cost effective.

Cloud Run for Anthos allows projects to stay on-prem while still enjoying the benefits of containers and the Cloud Run platform.

Later in the show, Donna tells us about Knative, which is the API Cloud Run is based on that helps create portability between Cloud Run versions, as well as portability to other vendors. We also get to hear the weirdest things she’s seen put in a container and run in Cloud Run!

fuYjXPmhwpI,DevOps with Nathen Harvey and Jez Humble: GCPPodcast 205,"Original post → https://goo.gle/2PM5cYj

Happy Thanksgiving! This week, Aja and Brian are talking DevOps with Nathen Harvey and Jez Humble. Our guests thoroughly explain what DevOps is and why it’s important. DevOps purposely has no official definition but can be thought of as a community of practice that aims to make large-scale systems reliable and secure. It’s also a way to get developers and operations to work together to focus on the needs of the customer.

Nathen later tells us all about DevOpsDays, a series of locally organized conferences occurring in cities around the world. The main goal is to bring a cross-functional group of people together to talk about how they can improve IT, DevOps, business strategy, and consider cultural changes the organization might benefit from. DevOpsDays supports this by only planning content for half the conference, then turning over the other half to attendees via Open Spaces. At this time, conference-goers are welcome to propose a topic and start a conversation.

Jez then describes the Accelerate State of DevOps Report, how it came to be, and why it’s so useful. It includes items like building security into the software, testing continuously, ideal management practices, product development practices, and more. With the help of the DevOps Quick Check, you can discover the places your company could use some help and then refer back to the report for suggestions of improvements in those areas.

vDMNw0hjvfs,ML/AI with Zack Akil: GCPPodcast 206,"Original post → https://goo.gle/35iCkgI

Gabi Ferrara and Jon Foust are joined today by fellow Googler Zack Akil to discuss machine learning and AI advances at Google. First up, Zack explains some of the ways AutoML Vision and Video can be used to make life easier. One example is how Google Photos are automatically tagged, allowing them to be searchable thanks to AutoML. Developers can also train their own AutoML to detect specific scenarios, such as laughing in a video.

We also talk Cloud Next 2019 and learn how Zack comes up with ideas for his cool demos. His goal is to inspire people to incorporate machine learning into their projects, so he tries to combine hardware and exciting technology to think of fun, creative ways developers can use ML. Recently, he made a smart AI bicycle that alerts riders of possible danger behind them through a system of lights and a project to track and photograph balls as they fly through the air after being kicked.

To wrap it all up, Zack tells us about some cool projects he’s heard people use AutoML for (like bleeping out tv show spoilers in online videos!) and the future of the software.

Mvb20NdZJDA,Verily's journey to the Cloud,"As one of Alphabet’s “bets,” Verily is essentially a distinct software company operating in a highly regulated industry (healthcare). Their large (250+) engineering team had significant experience with Google’s internal compute infrastructure but found compelling reasons to adopt the public Google Cloud platform instead.

Its adoption story has played out over the course of several years, culminating in a major release of its CSP product in 2020. Getting Verily to this point has created shareable best practices in cloud development and has led to the development of two products (Verily Cloud and Aditum), which are heading to our outside customers to share our internal learnings. 

Learn the highs and lows of Verily’s journey, the details of its best practices, and get a peek at the two products making this possible.

T6rdJ9n8Xi8,Lead your company towards data-powered innovation,"This talk presents a prescriptive, proven approach to foster the ability of your organization to innovate with data. This approach has helped Google Cloud customers handle key challenges around data size, speed, and (lack of) structure. This five-step journey provides immediate short-term benefits at every stage and sets your organization up for transformational growth.

The first step is to simplify operations and lower the total cost of ownership and build a common data platform by migrating legacy data warehouses and data lakes to the cloud. Next is to break down silos, democratize data access, and build a data culture. The third step is to make decisions in context (taking location and near-term behavior into account) and do so faster with real-time dashboards and real-time AI. The fourth step is to build the ability to absorb AI and leapfrog with end-to-end packaged AI solutions. Finally, with the ability to integrate AI already in place, is the time to empower data-driven innovation with scaled AI platforms.

KY4DozBVV1Y,An app modernization story with Cloud Run,"Back in 2016, an ASP.NET monolith app was deployed to IIS on Windows. While it worked, it was clunky in every sense of the word. Over the years, the app was freed from Windows (thanks to .NET Core), containerized to run consistently in different environments (thanks to Docker) and decomposed into a set of loosely-coupled, event-driven, microservices (thanks to Cloud Run). The end result is a simpler and portable serverless architecture that’s much cheaper to run and maintain. Join this talk which presents the modernization journey, explore the decision points, and deep dive into the final architecture and code.

K7SciFbITGo,"Using Google Cloud to serve 10,000s of personalized recs per second","In retail, it is personalize or die. Bluecore has a long history using BigQuery to generate and apply personalized recommendations. While this continues to work well in bulk, Google Cloud offers a variety of tools to enable real-time personalization.

These use cases require not only efficient code, but also data storage options that fit real-time access patterns. Products and customers alone present unique challenges that a small team would struggle to address in a self-hosted environment. Keeping data up to date and caches fresh while facing nearly constant updates is always a challenge. Using Google Cloud, Bluecore built a system that delivers tens of thousands of personalized recommendations per second, with a p95 SLO of under 100ms. They did it with a tiny team and in just a few months. 

Bluecore touches on how it uses the BigQuery Storage API, Cloud Storage, Bigtable, Datastore, Memorystore, Pub/Sub, Google Kubernetes Engine, and even a little App Engine standard to help retailers activate their customers and meet their revenue goals.

EQsnO_Jn88c,From siloed ML to ML service mesh using API Management,"The digital transformation in next decade will be empowered by what we call it as ""ML/AI Service Mesh"". Even though many companies are now generating features from raw data and extracting business insights with ML models, the challenge has been to share the valuable asset for internal and external consumption at scale. Each project or department in enterprises are siloed in the most of ML/AI projects; building features from raw data, training ML models, extracting embeddings, building prediction microservices, and use it internally. There is no standardized way to share the valuable assets and microservices with cross-functional groups and divisions.  
 
API management is the missing link for building the service mesh quickly. By introducing a standardized and established way of securing services, enabling service discovery, and observability, Operations teams don’t have to spend much resources on exposing the assets to enable the ML/AI Service Mesh across the enterprise. This approach democratizes the ML assets for faster and scalable enterprise-wide consumption.
 
Solution: AI Platform + Apigee Edge
In this session, learn from a ML model built in the Cloud Machine learning engine and look at ways on how to consume this model from an internal consumer and an external consumer perspective. We use Apigee’s API Management solution to expose the models. This video also touches upon how to build ""ML/AI Service Mesh"" where enterprises can build a collection of microservices that exposes the features. 
 
The demo provides: 
- Serving predictions with scalability, performance, and availability in mind 
- Authentication, authorization services depending on who the user is 
- Managing the life cycle of API keys 
- Granting access to your ML APIs with an approval process 
- Rolling out new model versions as models are updated 
- Self-service consumption using Portal without any DevOps involved 
- Monitoring and Analyzing Analytics
- Monetizing the ML Models

kqTuEQAxXIs,How to enable personalized dialogues with customers and employees (using GenAI),"Despite significant progress in deflecting calls to chatbots, there is continuous growth in customer calls. And when customers switch channels, they have to repeat everything, which hurts their experience. Our Cognizant Generative AI team has created a Gen AI bot that answers questions like no other bot before. It doesn’t need to be trained on standard FAQs - it detects context from questions, even when they’re not explicit. It speaks multiple languages and can take on different roles - agent, assistant, or even customer. This Gen AI bot has memory and can perform calculations on-the-fly using formulas it has self-learned. We partnered with Google Cloud and trained the Gen AI bot using state-of-the-art technology, private and public structured, semi and unstructured data , as well as national and regulatory guidelines. The result? A ground-breaking proof that Generative AI has enormous potential to significantly improve the customer experience.

dTZ8MI82MZQ,Forecast Product Demand with BigQuery ML,"Predictive analytics helps businesses move from guesswork to informed decisions—especially when it comes to inventory. Using sales data already stored in BigQuery, this demo walks through how to forecast future demand using BigQuery ML. With just a few lines of SQL, viewers see how to transform raw data, train an ARIMA model, and generate confident sales predictions without needing to export data or manage additional machine learning infrastructure.

The example focuses on an online pet supply store predicting demand for its top five products. By using BigQuery ML’s built-in tools, the process is fast, cost-effective, and doesn’t require extensive data science expertise. The result: smarter inventory decisions, fewer stockouts, and happier customers. Developers can follow along and try it themselves with the linked blog and codelab.

n8oa8XWZAvA,The real talk on agent evaluation,"Join Kristopher Overholt, Aja Hammerly, and Jason Davenport as they unpack how software engineers can practically approach building AI agents—without the hype. From defining what an agent is (“a program with a job”) to creating useful proof-of-concepts using tools like Gemini 2.5 Pro and grounding, the group shares approachable strategies for getting started. Kristopher explains how his own ""Hello World"" agent used long-term memory and web search to mirror real developer workflows, while Aja and Jason chime in with perspectives on coding styles, debugging, and how agent development fits into everyday engineering.

The trio also explores what it means to “vibe code” live at a developer event, and how to balance creativity with structure across teams and languages. In the final stretch, they tackle a critical but often overlooked topic: agent evaluation. They emphasize that effective measurement isn’t about perfection—it’s about closing the feedback loop, starting with a clear metric, and understanding that agents are layered systems built on tools, models, and reasoning. Whether you're experimenting with frontend tools or building backend logic, this episode delivers real-world insight into the evolving role of AI in software development.

kT2GjpQefqY,Self-Service Allowlisting of Privileged Apps on GKE Autopilot,"GKE allows a subset of approved partners to run privileged workloads in Autopilot clusters. These privileged workloads can bypass some of the security constraints that Autopilot enforces. For example, a partner might need to run a workload that uses specific Linux capabilities or requires a privileged container.  Partners create and maintain allowlists for their privileged workloads. Each allowlist is a file that matches a specific privileged partner workload. Partners submit these allowlist files to GKE for approval. After approval, GKE hosts the allowlist file in a Google-managed repository.  To run a partner workload, you install the corresponding allowlist file in your cluster. GKE provides a Kubernetes custom resource named the AllowlistSynchronizer that installs allowlists and keeps them up to date. After an allowlist installs successfully, you can deploy the corresponding privileged partner workload.

rqwVW6xAt5M,Building a resilient client app with .NET and AWS IOT,"In this video, Derek Bingham, Developer Advocate at AWS, shows how create a client application that communicates with AWS IOT Core using MQTT and .NET.

Why MQTT ? Well often we need to build application clients that need to communicate  over congested or unreliable networks.  If this same application has a requirement that all data MUST be persisted, then using traditional REST or GraphQL style API's can get complicated

However there is another way and you can harness the power of the MQTT message protocol along with AWS IOT Core to build your next client application to be have a more resilient message delivery mechanism AND you can do this in .NET.

This video will show you exactly how!

ZrybveqaWls,Building a Leaderboard with Amazon Managed Service for Apache Flink | 1/5,"Looking to level up your analytics? In this video, we’re diving into the fundamentals of streaming architecture, and how you can use Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for data ingestion. We’ll also cover gaming leaderboards as a use case, before walking you through how to set up the architecture and complete the data ingestion challenge in your own AWS account.

Please note deploying the infrastructure shown in this series will incur costs in your AWS account, so remember to stop all resources like Managed Flink Studio Notebooks when you’re not using them.

In this series, Anand Shah (Data Analytics and Streaming Specialist at AWS) will help you build a modern data streaming architecture for a real-time gaming leaderboard. This architecture includes data ingestion, real-time enrichment with database change data capture (CDC), data processing, as well as computing, storing and visualizing the results. You will also learn advanced streaming analytics techniques, such as the control channel
method for A/B testing, updating features and parameters with zero downtime, and how to handle late arrival of data. Anand will also talk you through the process of data de-duplication, as well as how you can store historical data for replay on-demand. 🎉

First, we'll extract these different data modalities using Python libraries like PyMuPDF. Then, we'll create embeddings for the extracted data using the Titan model from Amazon Bedrock. After storing the embeddings in a vector database, we can use a language model to retrieve relevant information and generate responses to queries. 

You'll see examples of asking questions related to text, images, and table data, showcasing Multimodal RAG's capability to handle multimodal inputs intelligently. Whether your data contains just text or a mix of modalities, this technique enables effective information retrieval and question answering.

__VYdewkLdY,Data Labelings using Amazon SageMaker GroundTruth (Hebrew),"Successful machine learning models are built on the shoulders of large volumes of high-quality training data. But, the process to create the training data necessary to build these models is often expensive, complicated, and time-consuming. 
The majority of models created today require a human to manually label data in a way that allows the model to learn how to make correct decisions.
SageMaker Ground Truth uses a machine learning model to automatically label raw data to produce high-quality training datasets quickly at a fraction of the cost of manual labeling.

P4x5pLuKP-I,AutoML with Amazon Autopilot (Hebrew),"Building machine learning (ML) models has traditionally required a binary choice. On one hand, you could manually prepare the features, select the algorithm, and optimize the model parameters in order to have full control over the model design and understand all the thought that went into creating it. However, this approach requires deep ML expertise. On the other hand, if you don’t have that expertise, you could use an automated approach (AutoML) to model generation that takes care of all of the heavy lifting, but provides very little visibility into how the model was created. While a model created with AutoML can work well, you may have less trust in it because you can’t understand what went into it, you can’t recreate it, and you can’t learn best practices which may help you in the future.


Amazon SageMaker Autopilot eliminates this choice, allowing you to automatically build machine learning models without compromises. With SageMaker Autopilot, you provide a tabular dataset and select the target column to predict, which can be a number (such as a house price, called regression), or a category (such as spam/not spam, called classification). SageMaker Autopilot will automatically explore different solutions to find the best model. You then can directly deploy the model to production with just one click, or iterate on the recommended solutions with Amazon SageMaker Studio to further improve the model quality.

6t4sxxCRL5A,Model debugging time from days to minutes (Hebrew),"Interested in learning how to debug model characteristics during training?

Training ML models is a multi-step, complex task that is iterative and time-consuming. During training, ML models learn patterns in the training data to make accurate predictions. This learning occurs through multiple iterations of the data and adjusting the parameter values for each iteration. It is challenging to ensure that a model is progressively learning the correct values of the different parameters. Additionally, it is not easy to analyze and debug model characteristics without building additional tools, making the entire process cumbersome.


Amazon SageMaker Debugger makes it much easier to easily analyze and debug model characteristics during training, using the Amazon SageMaker Studio visual interface. When anomalies are detected, SageMaker Debugger sends alerts for developers’ to take remedial actions, reducing the time it takes to debug models from days to minutes. The debug data remains in the customer’s AWS account, allowing SageMaker Debugger to be used for most privacy-sensitive applications.

PQnrR_YvlTE,Level Up Your Serverless Journey (Hebrew),"Serverless technology has become the standard for architecture and application development in different organizations and use cases. With Serverless solutions and services, organizations can focus on their business rather than the operations of the underlying systems, increasing overall agility. Creating serverless applications means your developers can focus on their core product rather than worrying about server management and operation or runtimes.


However, as with any new technology, you will need to learn best practices: which frameworks to use, how to set up monitoring and tracing, CI/CD and resource configuration, etc. In this session we will cover best practices and tools, hear customer use cases first hand, and discuss how to build and manage your serverless solution to meet the demand for your growing products.

HOs2W0B9d9M,Broadband Freedom: Unlocking Insights & Improving CPE Device Management with AWS,"More than ever before, consumers rely on their home networks for work, entertainment, and day-to-day life. Consumers are connecting more and more smart devices to the network, rely on high-speed connections to work from home, and stream rich content such as HD movies and video games. To power these experiences, telcos and communication service providers (CSPs) use a range of Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) (i.e. Set Top Boxes (STB), Broadband Routers, Wi-Fi Extenders, and Home Gateways) to deliver service offerings to customers. In this tech talk, we will discuss how Service Providers are using the cloud to develop innovative strategies that help them gather new data insights from their CPE device fleets and improve the way CPE devices are managed. With CPE data available for analysis in the cloud, service providers can use analytics and AI/ML tools to solve business problems (customer churn and retention analytics, predictive hardware diagnostics) and to improve their customer’s quality of experience (self-healing intelligent CPE devices, as an example). This session demonstrates how Service Providers can use AWS and AWS IoT services to enhance their current CPE management platforms, connect CPE devices securely to the cloud at scale, and to make use of the CPE data to improve their products and enhance consumer experiences.

Learning Objectives: 
*Learn use cases for the next generation of CPE devices powered by IoT, AI/ML and application management at the edge 
*Learn how Service Providers can securely and easily enhance their CPE data analytics and device management systems with AWS and AWS IoT 
*Understand how AWS and AWS IoT services can help Service Providers transform their broadband service and related offerings to deliver differentiated consumer experiences

NVJo4HQXX_s,Detect potential bias in your datasets and explain how your models predict (Hebrew),"As ML models are built by training algorithms that learn statistical patterns present in datasets, several questions immediately come to mind. First, can we ever hope to explain why our ML model comes up with a particular prediction? Second, what if our dataset doesn’t faithfully describe the real-life problem we were trying to model? Could we even detect such issues? Would they introduce some sort of bias in imperceptible ways? These are not speculative questions at all, and their implications can be far-reaching. Unfortunately, even with the best of intentions, bias issues may exist in datasets and be introduced into models with business, ethical, and legal consequences.

It is thus important for model builders and administrators to be aware of potential sources of bias in production systems. In addition, many companies and organizations need ML models to be explainable before they can be used in production. In fact, some regulations explicitly require model explainability for consequential decision making. In this hands-on session, you’ll learn how Amazon SageMaker Clarify can help you tackle bias and explainability issues, and how to use it with both the SageMaker Studio user interface and the SageMaker SDK. You’ll also see how it works together with SageMaker Model Monitor to track bias metrics over time on your prediction endpoints.

lJqXlm98ioU,Build a UGC Live Streaming App with Amazon IVS: Broadcast Low-Latency with Multi-Hosts (Lesson 4.4),"In this lesson, we'll see how to broadcast a real-time stream with multiple hosts to an Amazon IVS low-latency channel. As we've covered in previous lessons, real-time streaming with Amazon IVS gives a host the ability to interact with other remote hosts, but sometimes that real-time latency is not necessary for the viewers. The Amazon IVS Web Broadcast SDK makes streaming a real-time conversation to a low-latency channel very easy, so we can add low-latency to a real-time stream with very minimal code and effort.

0bZtIDrfAnc,Build a UGC Live Streaming App with Amazon IVS: Responding to Stream State Events (Lesson 3.5),"In this lesson, we'll look at how StreamCat responds to stream state events to update a channel's state or publish a VOD asset for a previous broadcast. If you recall from lesson 1.4, StreamCat uses an Amazon EventBridge rule to listen for various state change events related to our Amazon IVS channels. This EventBridge rule triggers an AWS Lambda function, and that function persists and updates database records as necessary. In this lesson, we'll focus on how StreamCat handles the following events:

-   Stream Start
-   Stream End
-   Recording Start
-   Recording End

NPQzf9zKZRI,"Build a UGC Live Streaming App with Amazon IVS: Permissions, Devices & Streams (Lesson 3.2)","In this lesson, you will learn about some of the common functions that StreamCat uses to create custom web broadcast experiences.

To broadcast from a web browser - whether in real time or low latency - we first need to obtain permission to access a user's camera and microphone. It's also important to list the available cameras and microphones, so that we can provide streamers with an option to change to a different device. Finally, you'll need to be familiar with how to create instances of a `MediaStream` for both the camera and the microphone since the Amazon IVS Web Broadcast SDK uses these to broadcast to an Amazon IVS channel.

H9fcwYFFZl4,Azure SQL Database: Columnstore indexes | Azure Friday,"Davide Mauri is back with Lara Rubbelke to discuss columnstore indexes. In a typical relational database data is stored per row. This means that all row columns are saved together, which is great in all those cases where you want to retrieve all the information related to a specific row. But what if you want to have all the data stored in a subset of columns but for all the rows? That would be complex and slow—unless data was saved per-column instead of per-row. That's exactly what columnstore indexes in Azure SQL Database enables you to do.

zeH01ZWPWeA,Shifting left to scale up: shortening the road to scalable quantum computing | Quantum Week 2021,"In the past, the development of a new computer technology followed a common path:  tape out a chip, develop the software, and then bring up the system.  But our road to scalable quantum computing needs to be different.  (Learn more: https://azure.com/quantum)

To bring in the timelines to scale, we need to close the gap between theory and development, and co-develop hardware and software.  We have an advantage of already knowing some of the problems we want to solve with quantum computers, up to a decade before we will implement them, and we know they require scaling the quantum machine to 1M qubits and beyond.  

To accelerate this scaling up, and to shorten the road ahead, requires early software development, the rapid evolution of devices, widespread community engagement, and continued exploration of the next wave of quantum algorithms and solutions.  

Krysta Svore will share how we’re working at Microsoft to help open up the stack, through software services, tools, and languages, to enable creative and collaborative innovation across the community, increased interoperability and flexibility among platforms and devices, and co-development of hybrid quantum solutions.  To scale up, we need to keep shifting left, together.

Optical character recognition (OCR) is sometimes referred to as text recognition. An OCR program extracts and repurposes data from scanned documents, camera images and image-only pdfs. OCR software singles out letters on the image, puts them into words and then puts the words into sentences, thus enabling access to and editing of the original content. It also eliminates the need for manual data entry. Watch IBM Master Inventor, Martin Keen, explain OCR's evolution and how OCR works today.

Quantum computers have the potential to solve certain classes of problems exponentially faster than any known classical techniques. In most cases, the theoretical proofs behind these speedups are decades old, but one exception to that rule is the exciting and highly active field of quantum machine learning (QML). In 2021, IBM researchers proved that quantum kernels can provide an exponential speedup over classical counterparts for certain classification problems. In this video, IBM Quantum developer advocate Abby Mitchell shows how QML methods give classical ML a boost, and explains how developers can start building their very own QML algorithms with Qiskit Runtime.

Neural networks are great for predictive modeling — everything from stock trends to language translations. But what if the answer is wrong, how do they “learn” to do better? Martin Keen explains that during a process called backward propagation, the generated output is compared to the expected output, and then the error contributed by each neuron (or “node”) is examined. By adjusting the node’s weights and biases, error is reduced and thus the overall accuracy improved.

bJ7beeCDpyo,IBM Keynote at Virtual AI Summit London 2020,"Learn more about IBM Cloud: https://ibm.biz/ibm-cloud-mainpage

Now more than ever, customers are relying on digital interactions with businesses, expecting them to be seamless and secure. Businesses in every single industry are working quickly to develop new and expanded ways to digitally engage with their customers while accelerating their shift to the cloud. As enterprises grapple with modernizing operations, the benefits of their digital transformation must be balanced by the certainty that it will bring sustainable value. 

Howard Boville, Senior Vice President, IBM Cloud, recently discussed how a strong architecture strategy and deep industry expertise are critical to your hybrid cloud journey and digital transformation success at the AI Summit London 2020 event. 

During the event he also addresses key questions around why an open architecture matters as businesses embark on their digital journey and why hybrid cloud matters to bridge the gap between the new world of cloud and traditional technology investments.

From the earliest days of Apollo when NASA landed the first humans on the moon, IBM has had the distinct honor of playing a key role in NASA's space exploration efforts. 

Fast forward 50 years to today and IBM is still innovating in space. Through a partnership with NASA, ISS National Lab, HPE, and Red Hat, IBM has developed an edge computing and space solution that eliminates the need to move massive libraries of DNA sequencing data by providing containerized analytical code locally right on the ISS where the data originates.
